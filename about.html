				<h3>The main purpose of this site is to share information...specifically about Afro hair and care.</h3>
				<p>I want this site to be:<p>
					<ul>
						<li>A good place to find out where you can get your hair done, no matter where you are in UK </li>
						<li>Show off you're amazing do's and get the recognition that the work of art on your head deserves</li>
						<li>Call out and warn others about bad stylists/hairdressers</li>
						<li>Get or provide good personal hair advice</li>
						<li>Recommend great products</li>
						<li>Sell your hair services </li>
					</ul>

				<section class="History">
					<h3>I actually had the idea to create this site years ago.</h3>
					<p>It was highly irritating! Every time my hair started to look less stylish and more like some form of wilderness reserve I had to make the decision to either schlep home, wasting valuable time and booze money, take a chance on the one local hairdresser, or (heaven forbid!*) do it myself</p>
					<img class="bighair" src="/home/hannahob/Desktop/FK/Image/bighair2.jpg">
					<p>That really only gave me two options:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Go home and have someone I trust do it. But this would mean that I usually had to put aside more than a day and find the extra money for the travel. In addition I’d have to make sure my schedule matched my hairdressers, which wasn’t always ideal, especially if it was an emergency job.</li>
						<li>Take my chances at the local hairdresser. To be fair, sometimes they did a stella job, but it was very hit a miss. Sometimes I'd get the lady who'd just arrived from Africa – she was amazing at braids and plaits, but the side part weave was atrocious and the relaxer left my head feeling like Hiroshima after the bomb!</li>

					</ol>

				<section class="summary">
					<p>In this day and age I was always left wondering why I didn't have more options and more information. Wouldn't it have been great to have somewhere I could check out the hairdressers galley before walking into the shop and having 3 scary women stare at me till I made an 'on-the-spot' decision; or at least somewhere I could vent about the abuse that I had willingly undergone for the sake of beauty. </p>
					<p>Truth be told, I always assumed someone else would think up something similar to this site. Sadly, it hasn't happened yet, so I'll give it a go.</p>
					<p>I'm always happy to hear other people's horror stories and I'm open to suggestions for this site so please feel free to get in touch if you have something to share.<a href="hanaobz@gmail.com"> hanaobz@gmail.com</a></p>
					<p>*just joking – nothing wrong with doing it yourself if you can – I'm just not very good at more than braids.</p>
